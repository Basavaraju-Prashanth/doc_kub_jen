================ Steps to Install Puppet Master and Agent =========================

1. Create 2 VM's either using VMWare Workstation or Virtual Box 

Configure the Master server with minimum of 2 GB of Memroy

2. Add the hosts file entry in both the servers and make sure both are reachable using ping command

3. Update the NTP service to latest if already installed or install the package fresh on both the servers,
#yum install -y ntp

4. Once installed on both servers, 
#systemctl enable ntpd
#systemctl restart ntpd
#systemctl status ntpd

5. Disable firewall on both the servers,
#systemctl status firewalld
#systemctl stop firewalld

Once the basic installation is done the hosts should look like,
On Master:
==========
[root@puppet ~]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
192.168.60.129 puppet
192.168.60.131 agent


On Agent:
=========
[root@agent ~]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
192.168.60.129 puppet
192.168.60.131 agent


============ On Master Node

1. Run the below command to install the rpm puppetlabs,
[root@puppet ~]# rpm -ivh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm

2. On Successful installation , install the puppetserver
[root@puppet ~]# yum install puppetserver

3. After succesful installation of puppet server, try to bring up the service,
#systemctl enable puppetserver.service
#systemctl start puppetserver.service  --If this command fails with below status

Job for puppetserver.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status puppetserver.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
[root@puppet ~]# systemctl status puppetserver

Mar 14 04:47:53 puppet puppetserver[10290]: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=256m; support was removed in 8.0

4. Then the issue is with memory and modified the below parameter in file /etc/sysconfig/puppetserver
Earlier:
# Modify this if you'd like to change the memory allocation, enable JMX, etc
JAVA_ARGS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

After modification:
# Modify this if you'd like to change the memory allocation, enable JMX, etc
JAVA_ARGS="-Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

After modification again restart the puppetserver service it should be running

5. Update the puppet.conf file under /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ with entries
certname = puppet

 [main]
 certname = puppet
 server = puppet
 environment = production
 runinterval = 1h

 6. Restart the puppetserver service,
 #systemctl restart puppetserver.service

 ==================== On Puppet Agent,

 1. Run the command,
 #rpm -ivh https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm

 2. After successful installation run the puppet agent,
 #yum install puppet-agent

 3. After successful installation , start the puppet service
 #systemctl enable puppet.service
 #systemctl start puppet.service

 4. Update the puppet.conf file under /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ with entries
 [main]
    certname = agent
    server = puppet
    environment = production
    runinterval = 1h

 With the above steps both Puppet Master and Agent installation will be successful

 On the Master node view for certificates waiting for signature,

 #/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert list  --List all certificates waiting for sign

If the 1st space is empty , then waiting to sign
IF the 1st space is + then it is signed
If the 1st space is -ve then the certficate is rejected
