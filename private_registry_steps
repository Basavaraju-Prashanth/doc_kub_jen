===== Steps to Create the Private Registry in the local

Docker provides a build image registry:2 which will helps in setting up a private registry.

You can do with by running the image locally or through docker compose file,

Go to / folder and create a new docker compose file,
version: '3'  -- Version of the docker compose file

services:
  registry:    -- service name
    image: registry:2  -- image name
    ports:
    - "5000:5000"   -- port mapping 
    environment:
      REGISTRY_AUTH: htpasswd   
      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: Registry Realm
      REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: /auth/registry.password
    volumes:
      - ./auth:/auth  -- path / bind volume created under /auth


create a new folder /auth and under /auth create a user and password,

#yum install httpd-tools -- for centos
#mkdir /auth
#cd /auth
#htpasswd -Bc registry.password testuser  -- this will prompt for password and provide the details

How to create a local registry and push / pull from local private repository

#docker run -it -d --name regitry -p 5000:5000 registry:2  --This will pull the image from docker hub and create container with name registry.

We need to pull the image from docker and tag the image , push to localhost

#docker pull alpine  --This will pull the image from docker hub
#docker tag alpine localhost:5000/alpine-local 

#docker images --List new images

#docker push localhost:5000/alpine-local  -- Will push the image to local host

#docker pull localhost:5000/alpine-local

This will install the local image 

#docker run -it --name local-image localhost:5000/alpine-local sh

This will create the container

---- Setting Up Authentication 

After creating the password using htpassword and docker compose file 
#docker-compose up -d  -- This will create the new container along with authentication set,

#docker login localhost:5000 
username:
password:
