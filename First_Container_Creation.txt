======== Steps to create a simple docker container ===============
Let's create simple nginx container using the docker run command,
#docker run --name nginx_container -p 5000:80 -d nginx

-d option refers to run the container in the background
-p option is port mapping from container to host where 5000 is port of the host and 80 is port of the container

After container is created you can view the status of the container using,
#docker ps --> This command list all current running container details

#docker ps -a --> This commmand provide all containers that were executed.

#docker inspect nginx_container --> This command provides complete details of the container

#docker logs nginx_container --> This command provide log details of the container 

#docker logs 

Issues:

After the container was created , when tried to view the portal through browser an error encounter as port forwarding not enabled.
Added a new line under /etc/sysctl.conf file and restarted the network service

#vi /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

#systemct restart network

[root@demo learning]# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                   NAMES
52d00455b538   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:5000->80/tcp, :::5000->80/tcp   nginx

#docker images --> List all images pulled from docker hub

#docker stop nginx --> Stop the container

#docker rm nginx --> Remove the container

#docker rmi nginx --> Remove the image

Image can only be removed after all containers part of the image are removed.
