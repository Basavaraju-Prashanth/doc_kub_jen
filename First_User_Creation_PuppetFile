======= Steps to Create First Manifest File and Push them to Puppet Agent

Create a new user and add the user in both puppet master and agent

1. Create a new folders under,
#cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules
#mkdir -p user_create/manifests
#mkdir -p user_create/tests

2. Create a new puppet file as all puppet files inside manifests use .pp file extensions
#cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/user_create/manifests
#vim init.pp
class user_create{   -- Class Name and Module Name should be same

  user {'john':                 -- Create new user john 
       ensure => 'present',     -- Make sure it is created
       home => '/root/john',    -- Home folder should be as mentioned
       gid => 'developer',      -- User is attached to group developer
       password => '$1$vNco1zXa$smqfIllgX/or/04MhvA1o.',  -- Password for John user
       managehome => true,  -- Make sure the home folder exists

  }

  group {'developer':  -- Create new group developer
        ensure => 'present', -- Make sure group created / exists
  }

  file {'/root/john':  -- Folder Name
       ensure => 'directory', -- Check if folder exists
  }

}


3. Create a new file under under,
#cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/user_create/tests
[root@puppet manifests]# cat ../tests/init.pp
include user_create

4. We can validated the manifests file,
[root@puppet manifests]# /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet parser validate init.pp

5. We can perform the testing with out implementing on master ,
[root@puppet manifests]# puppet apply --noop ../tests/init.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for puppet in environment production in 0.12 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/User_create/Group[developer]/ensure: current_value absent, should be present (noop)
Notice: /Stage[main]/User_create/User[john]/ensure: current_value absent, should be present (noop)
Notice: /Stage[main]/User_create/File[/root/john]/ensure: current_value absent, should be directory (noop)
Notice: Class[User_create]: Would have triggered 'refresh' from 3 events
Notice: Stage[main]: Would have triggered 'refresh' from 1 events
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.04 seconds


6. Now we can implemented on the master ,
[root@puppet user_create]# /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet apply tests/init.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for puppet in environment production in 0.13 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/User_create/Group[developer]/ensure: created
Notice: /Stage[main]/User_create/User[john]/ensure: created
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.32 seconds

7. Now we can run on puppet agent by adding the below lines,
[root@puppet manifests]# pwd
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests
[root@puppet manifests]# cat site.pp
node agent{
 class { 'user_create': }
}

8. Now create the user in agent by running command,
[root@agent ~]# /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent -t
