====== Puppet Examples

1. Copying a file from master to agents

Lets create a simple text file and copy that to specific folder in the agents

a. Go to production module folder ad create a new folder,
#cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/
#mkdir -p copyfiles/{files,tests,manifests,templates}

This will create a folder alone with sub folder
[root@puppet modules]# tree copyfiles
copyfiles
├── files
│   └── data.conf
├── manifests
│   └── init.pp
├── templates
└── tests
    └── init.pp

 b. Create the manifest file under manifests folder,
 #cd copyfiles/manifests
 #vi init.pp
#cat copyfiles/manifests/init.pp
class copyfiles{ -- Class Name and module name should be same

file {'/tmp/data.conf':   -- Resource type is file and the path where it will be copied in agents
     ensure => present,   
     owner => root,  -- owner of the file
     group => root, 
     mode => '0777', -- permission of the file
     source => 'puppet:///modules/copyfiles/data.conf',  -- path where the file will be stored in the master.
    }
}


c. Create a new file under files folder with name specified in the manifests file,
#cat copyfiles/files/data.conf
This file will be copied from master to agents

d. Include the file in the test folder,
#cat copyfiles/tests/init.pp
include copyfiles

e. Validate the main manifests file,
#/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet parser validate copyfiles/manifests/init.pp

f. After validation test with implementation
[root@puppet modules]# /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet apply --noop copyfiles/tests/init.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for puppet in environment production in 0.11 seconds
Error: Parameter mode failed on File[/tmp/data.conf]: The file mode specification must be a string, not 'Fixnum' at /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/copyfiles/manifests/init.pp:3

Error occured due to mode was mentioned as numerical value  it was missed to place the value as string inside single quotes('')

After updating the value with quotes test passed

[root@puppet modules]# /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet apply --noop copyfiles/tests/init.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for puppet in environment production in 0.06 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Copyfiles/File[/tmp/data.conf]/ensure: current_value absent, should be file (noop)
Notice: Class[Copyfiles]: Would have triggered 'refresh' from 1 events
Notice: Stage[main]: Would have triggered 'refresh' from 1 events
Notice: Applied catalog in 0.08 seconds

g. Update the site.pp file to apply on the agents,
[root@puppet modules]# cat /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp
node agent,agent2{
 class { 'user_create': }
 class { 'copyfiles': }
}

On Agents ,

[root@agent ~]# /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent -t
